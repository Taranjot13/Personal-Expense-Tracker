## About

This project demonstrates modern software engineering practices including:

- **Clean Architecture** with separation of concerns
- **Repository Pattern** for data abstraction
- **Profile-based Configuration** for environment management
- **Comprehensive Testing** with unit and integration tests
- **Global Exception Handling** for robust error management
- **Input Validation** with Bean Validation API
- **Containerization** with Docker for consistent deployment
- **Infrastructure as Code** with Terraform
